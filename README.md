# Mathematics and Programming

In this repository I am going to write some codes based on C# and and maybe others like C and Python. I am beginner in Programming World.
I am writing a code in *ClassDiagram* to calculate area, perimeter and volume of shapes. For that, known can be Points, sides or radius.

**NB.:** *I accept improvement suggestions on my codes.*
